\begin{itemize}
\item We implement Economic MPC for supply chain systems after a short
  review of the economic MPC closed-loop stability theory.
\item We propose a novel multiobjective cost function that considers
  both economic cost and risk (modeled as penalty for deviations from safety stock)
\item We provide an example of integrating control theory and
  scheduling method by identifying terminal constraints that ensure
  recursive feasibility for a scheduling problem.
