Reviewers' comments:
 

Reviewer #1: The paper presents a rigorous formulation and analysis of economic MPC for the problem of inventory management in supply chains.  A novel cost function is presented;  the approach enables the integration of the scheduling and inventory control tasks as well.  A number of illustrative examples are presented.

I do not see issues of technical correctness with the paper; however, the paper is hampered somewhat by a lack of accessibility in the presentation that may be acceptable in other journals, but I would hope not be the case in CACE.  This is illustrated in Section 2, for example.  My additional recommendation would have to do with adding some discussion and/or analysis by the authors regarding how characteristics of the "real" problem would be addressed under the current formulation.   A real problem will likely have 1) longer (and uncertain) lead times and  2) uncertain demand.  In these scenarios, I would perhaps not be so eager to have MPC with an economic objective function, as having guarantees of stability would not be sufficient.  Somehow the economic objective function would have to allow  a means to incorporate potentially significant robustness margins in the response, while still maintaining meaningfulness as a  metric. Can the authors justify why would the
proposed approach be better than a well-coordinated hierarchical approach, which would maintain a separation between the control and scheduling layers?

A minor issue: some of the references need to be updated, particularly those that involve the existence of journal versions of papers cited from conferences.  This applies to References [2] and [13], for example.



Reviewer #2: Since the authors are dealing with inventory management in supply chains, which often have integer units (books, parts, etc.), they should at least discuss the limits of their continuous variable formulation for these problems. While the difference between 50.5 and 51 units/day will not radically change a solution, presumably 1.25 units/day would require 3 days of 1 unit and 1 day of 2 units. 

While the authors discuss periodic supply chains, I would like to better understand how this relates to a typical Federal Express or UPS problem, where deliveries are made daily, with perhaps Saturday mornings but no Saturday afternoon or Sunday service.
